# Build Pong

## Description
Build Pong is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python's Turtle graphics library. Players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth, aiming to score points by getting the ball past their opponent's paddle.

## Installation
To run the game, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the `Build_Pong` folder.
2. Navigate to the `Build_Pong` directory.
3. Run the `main.py` file using Python.

python main.py
```

## Controls
- **Right Paddle**: 
  - Up Arrow: Move Up
  - Down Arrow: Move Down
- **Left Paddle**: 
  - W: Move Up

## Game Logic
- The game runs in a window with a black background.
- Players control their paddles to hit the ball.
- The game continues until one player misses the ball more than 10 times.

## Scoring System
- The scoreboard tracks the scores of both players.
- Each time a player misses the ball, the opponent scores a point.
- The game ends when a player reaches a score of 10 misses.
