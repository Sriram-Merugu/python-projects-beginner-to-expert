# Alaram-Clock
This Python script demonstrates a simple alarm clock using the tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI) and the playsound library for playing an alarm sound. It allows users to set a specific time for the alarm to go off and plays a sound when the set time is reached.

# Dependencies
1. Python 3.x
2. tkinter library
3. playsound library

# Usage
1. Run the script: python AlarmClock.py
2. Enter the desired alarm time in the format HH:MM using a 24-hour clock.
3. Click the "Set Alarm" button to set the alarm.
4. When the current time matches the set alarm time, the alarm sound will play.
5. A pop-up window will appear indicating that the alarm has finished.
