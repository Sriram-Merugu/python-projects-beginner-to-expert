## Overview
This project is a Python-based simulation of Blackjack, also known as "21." The objective of the game is to beat the dealer by either:

1. Getting a score of 21 on the first two cards (Blackjack).
2. Reaching a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21.
3. Making the dealer draw cards until their hand exceeds 21.

---


## How to Play
1. The player and dealer are each dealt two cards.
2. The player is given the option to draw another card (`y`) or pass (`n`).
3. The dealer draws cards until their score is at least 17.
4. The winner is decided based on the scores.

**Rules:**
- Cards 2-10 are worth their face value.
- Face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 10 points.
- Aces (11) are worth either 11 or 1, depending on the hand value.
- If a player's score exceeds 21, they "bust" and lose.

## Code Overview
The game is divided into several functions:

1. **deal_card()**: Draws a random card from the deck.
2. **calculate_score()**: Calculates the current score of the cards.
3. **compare()**: Compares the user's and dealer's scores to determine the outcome.
4. **play_game()**: Manages the game logic and flow.
5. **Main Loop**: Repeats the game as long as the user wants to play.
