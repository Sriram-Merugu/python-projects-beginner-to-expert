1. **`is_resource_sufficient(order_ingredients)`**
   - Checks if the resources are sufficient for the requested coffee.

2. **`process_coins()`**
   - Processes user inputs for coins and calculates the total amount.

3. **`is_transaction_successful(money_received, drink_cost)`**
   - Verifies payment sufficiency and updates profit.

4. **`make_coffee(drink_name, order_ingredients)`**
   - Prepares the coffee and deducts resources.

### Main Loop
- Continuously prompts the user for actions (`espresso`, `latte`, `cappuccino`, `report`, `off`).
